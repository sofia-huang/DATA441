## Project 3
# Gradient Boosting Algorithm
#### Goal: Implement the Gradient Boosting algorithm with user defined choices for Regressor_1 and Regressor_2. Test the Boosted Locally Weighted Regressor with different choices of data (such as "cars.csv", "concrete.csv" and "housing.csv") and different choice of kernels, such as Gaussian, Tricubic, Epanechnikov and Quartic. Use k-fold cross validations and compare with other regressors.
